Hi  ,   

I have uploated the virtual eeprom project to the github.

Following is completed list:
1. Master send the 2k data to slave by multi packages.
2. Slave recieve the data of the multi packages and save to the flash.
3. Master send the  total crc to slave.
4. Slave receive the total crc, and compare with all the received data's crc (caculated by the stm32 register). 
5. Slave read all the data in the flash, then caculate the crc. and check the crc. 

Next steps:
1. Try to reduce the power up time of the master and the slave unit.  
2. Test the program at the IDE of the stm32cubeide.   (now is at keil)


Best Regards! 
Thanks,
Zhao

Hi  ,

Thank you for updating! We are doing a thorough review of all the hardware assembles tomorrow and will provide feedback so we can get these ordered ASAP.

Have you been able to use the library components in your design or are you still unable to access these?

Also, please see the attached step file of the CD pcb concept. This is a rough concept design which you can use to start the layout but there is plenty of flexibility here. Have you started the design of the CD yet? There are a lot of things to contemplate and decide with this design. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
