we are using 4031 at Az DG site, it was sourced from China if i am not mistaken, can you check with Hope about 4031 glue and where can you get it in China

yeah i got that, i though you have a specific recommendation for an A/B glue

we do need something quickly...  the delivery deadline is fast approaching.

whats the quantity you are supporting for this delivery and is it for Az  internal testing ?

Please source Loctite 403 Low Odor Low Bloom along with the following UV glues :   3926  3103

we can't get 3926 or 3103 from the Loctite Taobao store.  There are other stores available, but unknown if this is genuine, or just a case of a sticker put onto a generic UV glue...
