Hi Team,

Effective today, AAA is no longer with COMPANY. We thank him for his work and wish him all the best moving forward.

We understand that changes to the team can raise questions but out of respect for everyone¡¯s privacy, we don¡¯t share details about individual personnel decisions. Please know that every decision we make is guided by what¡¯s in the best interest of the organization and our team as a whole.

We're committed to maintaining a supportive and productive environment for everyone, and we appreciate your continued focus as we move forward together.

If you have any immediate questions about transitioning responsibilities, please feel free to reach out to Doug Bryan or me .
